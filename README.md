# Prize's Cluster

Hello! This is a collection of `docker-compose.yml` that I use in my home lab, usually on a _"stack"_ in [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io) _(which is a Docker GUI)_!

Some _"clusters"_ have environment variables, so before starting them take a look and read the necessary env vars!
